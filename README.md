# lem_global_optimize

Tests are run out of the tests.ipynb notebook - this should be run first and any errors in the assertions indicate something wrong with the setup / simplem class

The global optimisation can be run via the Run_montecarlo script, where model parameters are described there and in the text of the manuscript.

Duplicate analysis is rather tedious and therefore I included the scripts in the duplicate_analysis notebook - although you can find octopus minus duplicates in the google drive folder below
