# lem_global_optimize
The simplem_par classes should be alright - no need to modify. Should be able to run the tests in tests.ipynb - hopefully it is straight forward but ofcourse these things never end up being exactly as anticipated...

We mostly want to run the Run_montecarlo.py script.  The main thing that needs to be modified in that script right away are the data folders. 

The DEMs can 
be downloaded from here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RFB2hERkK8OvD_2yHnJRm4W5JxzSfkvi/view?usp=sharing

The octopus data is found here:

Todo: Add bash scripts for running monte carlo on the cluster, add scripts for generating figures
