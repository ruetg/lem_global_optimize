# lem_global_optimize
The simplem_par classes should be alright - no need to modify
Although Should be able to run the tests in tests.ipynb

We mostly want to run the Run_montecarlo.py script.  The main thing that needs to be modified in that script right away are the data folders. The DEMs can 
be downloaded from here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RFB2hERkK8OvD_2yHnJRm4W5JxzSfkvi/view?usp=sharing

Todo: Add bash scripts for running monte carlo on the cluster
